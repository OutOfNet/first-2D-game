# first-2D-game
Pretty self explanatory, made using godot 4.3 and some free to use assets, i don't really plan on publishing it for now, this is mostly to learn, however i could compile the game that i will publish here if anyone is curious to try it out.
### Latest changes
Reworked the UI to better scale with different window sizes (the game still renders at 1152x648 no matter the window size), this is done to have better multiplatform support.
