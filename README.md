# frst-2D-game
Pretty self explanatory, made using godot 4.3 and some free to use assets, i don't really plan on publishing it for now, this is mostly to learn.

Also i should probably finish the third level, and make the first and second level a bit longer and more interesting, they're quite bland right now.
